# SpriteCutter
>Currently in Beta

SpriteCutter is a utility that allows users to isolate sprite animations from a spritesheet, and export a file (.sc) which can be imported into their favorite engine or framework.

## Steps to use

- Import image files using the new drop-down button:
[1]("res/1.PNG")
[2]("res/2.PNG")

- Create layers and draw on the pixel divisions to form an animation area:
[3]("res/3.PNG")
